            Karthik is a rich post graduate from ISB who completes his studies and returns to India after a world tour.
             One day, he spots Nandana and falls head over heels for her. However Nandana develops hatred for Karthik.
              When Karthik proposes to her, she rejects him point blank. Karthik's marriage was arranged with Nandana but unfortunately,
               he does not know this. The bride accidentally turns out to be Nandana. Karthik's maternal uncle Pandu returns from Dubai 
               and because of his hatred towards Karthik, he plans to take revenge by jeopardizing his match when he finds out that Karthik
                actually loves Nandana, but Karthik finds out the truth and accepts to marry her. She is not interested in this marriage but 
                she does not want to oppose her father due to her love for him. When she tries to reject the marriage, both their parents complete
                 the procedures and they are pronounced engaged.
